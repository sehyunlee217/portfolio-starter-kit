2 weeks has passed since the start of summer break. Luckily enough, I received a MIE undergraduate research scholarship and will work at Professor Alfred's SED lab, assisting on designing and testing the PSE user reporting interface. There's a lot to read with regards to research in terms of both content and research in general; however, I really do look forward to working on this project.

With exception to summer research, I am learning PyTorch and Scala on my free time. If I'm being honest, it's pretty hard to stay focused and study on my own. However, I do not want to look back the time I have right now and regret that I haven't spent it wisely; I really want to make the best out of it.
