> Time flies when trying to understand things.

Regardless of whether it is a mathematical proof, documentation for a new framework,
or even figuring out how to use a record player, understanding new ideas has intrigued me
since I was little.

This helped me to do well in school, especially in the math and sciences, but it also
led me to spend a long time feeling unsure about what I wanted to do because there
were just too many interesting things in the world to choose from.

Feeling unsure, I intentionally made the decision to choose the safest and most flexible options
for my undergraduate degree. However, now I realizeâ€”being curious and open to learning and understanding is one of my greatest strengths.

Currently, my focus is on data science and statistics. I'm fascinated by being able to understand and extract information from data to make decisions that impact peoples' lives.
Utilizing mathematics to answer important questions and finding patterns is also remarkably satisfiying.

My speciality includes my passion for life-long learning, tackling problems, and a general knowledge of the world.
I have worked with Python, JavaScript, Java, React JS, Node JS, d3.JS, and NEXT.JS.

I'm finishing this [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/book/index.html) by the end of the semester and
started learning Scala, ApacheSpark, and more SQL, alongside interesting programming languages or subjects that show up along the way.
