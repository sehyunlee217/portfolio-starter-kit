The past couple of weeks were busy with midterms but it's finally over. It's almost 1AM at night but I just wanted to keep track of some updates that are going on right now.

1. Community Garden containers are getting built and seeds are to be planted soon.
2. I completed the run through of Flutter on its website and I think the direction that we want to take in terms of the ideation for the mobile game is in place. Now it's more about spending time learning Flutter and its Flame engine.
3. I started the Tableau learning course from its educational platform.
