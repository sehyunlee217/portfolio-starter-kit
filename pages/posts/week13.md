In the past 2 weeks, I've spent a lot of time contemplating on what I wanted to do in the future, but more importantly **why**.

It's something that I've thought about during my time in the military, but it didn't feel too important back then. At that moment, I thought that after some time, and after being discharged, all my problems I had with the question of why would naturally dissolve.

Which seemed true, at least until last year. The excitement and enthusiasm of being back at school after 3 years drove my passion for studying, alongside some excellent courses, professors, and friends.

The start of this year felt a bit different. Everytime I sat down for work, I could not see the purpose of being here in Canada, being in school, and studying for courses that I don't really have a passion for.

I even did pretty horrid on my tests in the past weeks, due to my lack of attention, focus, and maybe even my inability to study properly. As I look back, I know could have done better. I guess in some ways I was quite lost.

Now, after really thinking about what I wanted to achieve and why, I feel a lot better and I am also writing it down here so that i) I will be held credible to it but also ii) everytime I feel lost, I could come back and look at what I'm working for.

Here are the goals that are actually meaningful to me and why:

1. **Financial Freedom** - Spending time with people I care about is the most important to me. However, in order to make the most out of the limited time that we all have, I need to reach financial freedom first.
2. **Expertise** - I want to get what I want by deserving what I want; the best way to take this into action is to be the very best at my field of work.
3. **Helping Others** - I had the previlege of being able to choose my options my whole life and there are many who do not. Helping others is my responsibility.
